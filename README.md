# GPPAO (formerly TMBA)
Simple Budgeting App - made by thedeadbolt and Gustavo Daniel.
This is a simple budgeting app you can use monthly to track your expenses and spendings, Simplifying your finances.

v1 - meant to be used as a very basic / rudimentary tool.

With future updates the goal for GPPAO is to be a full fledged tool you can use if programs like Excel are "too much" for simple arithmetic tasks. 

v2- added saving and loading into a .json file.

Short term updates : organizing code/ add more features/ improve user interface.
Long term updates : add complex finance tools / graph visualization tools.

# TEST:

```bash
$ git clone: https://github.com/thedeadbolt/TMBA.git
